### **Epic: Employee Management**

**Description:** As an HR Administrator, I need to manage employee information to ensure accurate and timely payroll processing.

**User Story 1: Add a New Employee**

**Title:** Add New Employee Record

**As an** HR Administrator,
**I want to** add a new employee to the system by entering their personal, employment, and salary details,
**So that** they can be included in future payroll runs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Given I am on the "Employees" page, when I click the "Add Employee" button, a form appears with fields for personal details (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Address), employment details (Job Title, Department, Hire Date), and salary information (Salary Amount, Pay Frequency).
2.  When I fill out the required fields and click "Save," the new employee record is created and appears in the employee list.
3.  If I try to save without filling in all required fields, I see an error message indicating which fields are missing.
4.  If I enter an email address that already exists for another employee, I see an error message preventing a duplicate entry.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**
*   Data validation for email format, phone number format, and date format.
*   Role-based access control: Only users with HR Administrator privileges can add new employees.

**User Story 2: View Employee Details**

**Title:** View Employee Details

**As an** HR Administrator,
**I want to** view a list of all employees and be able to click on an individual employee,
**So that** I can see their detailed information on a dedicated page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Given I am on the "Employees" page, I can see a table with columns for Employee Name, Job Title, Department, and Hire Date.
2.  When I click on an employee's name in the list, I am navigated to a page that displays all of their personal, employment, and salary details.
3.  The employee list should be searchable and sortable by each column.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**
*   Pagination for the employee list if there are a large number of employees.
*   Sensitive information (like salary) might be masked or require extra permissions to view.

**User Story 3: Edit Employee Information**

**Title:** Edit Existing Employee Record

**As an** HR Administrator,
**I want to** edit the information of an existing employee,
**So that** I can keep their records up-to-date with changes like promotions, salary increases, or personal detail updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Given I am viewing an employee's detail page, when I click the "Edit" button, the fields become editable.
2.  When I make changes to the employee's information and click "Save," the updated information is stored and reflected on the details page.
3.  I can edit personal, employment, and salary information.
4.  A record of changes (audit trail) is maintained, showing what was changed, by whom, and when.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**
*   What happens to historical payroll records if an employee's salary is changed? The change should apply from a specific effective date.
*   Concurrent editing: What happens if two administrators try to edit the same employee's record at the same time?

**User Story 4: Deactivate an Employee**

**Title:** Deactivate Employee Record

**As an** HR Administrator,
**I want to** mark an employee as "inactive" or "terminated" with a specific end date,
**So that** they are no longer included in future payroll runs after their termination date.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Given I am viewing an employee's detail page, I have an option to "Deactivate Employee."
2.  When I choose to deactivate, I am prompted to enter a termination date and reason.
3.  Once an employee is deactivated, they no longer appear in the active employee list but can be found in a separate "Inactive Employees" list.
4.  The deactivated employee is not included in any payroll runs that occur after their termination date.

**Edge Cases and Considerations:**
*   Final pay calculation for the terminated employee.
*   Reactivating a previously terminated employee.
